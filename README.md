# VICENTIA'S STREAMLIT DASHBOARD APP
#Streamlit Geospatial Dashboard

This  is a geospatial dashboard built with Streamlit to visualize world population data. It allows users to select a country from a dropdown menu and view the country’s population data, including a bar chart of population over the years, and key statistics like area and population density. The app also displays an interactive map centered on the country’s capital with boundaries highlighted.

The dashboard uses data from a CSV file for population and a GeoJSON file for country boundaries. The app is responsive, ensuring it works well on all screen sizes, and is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access.
